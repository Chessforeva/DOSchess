   jan.2025(added buttons for mouse)

Important
---------
Go full screen (Alt+Enter) when running on DosBox!

Reasons
-------
DosBox emulator could also be used for
simple 2D games development (why not).
Dosbox (+):
 +portable even to mobiles
 +DOS is ducumented
 +there are tools and compilers
 +16mb extended memory isn't 2mb that PCs had;
 +default mouse
 +video recording (Ctrl+Alt+F5)

Description
-----------
So, this 256 colour chess project plays decent chess
for experimental and presentational purposes.
The chess engine GnuChess 3.version was used, newest
versions are too much incompatible.
Uses memory allocation and windows bitmaps in resources. 

OpenWatcom C compiler compiled and linked this
 DOS executable, it is not for windows originally.

As compiler, Watcom is well documented and there are
 functions for graphics or extended memory usage.

Conclusion
----------
Great platform for simple Tetris programming.
